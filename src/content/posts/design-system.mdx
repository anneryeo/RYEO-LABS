# Design System for Ryeo Labs

## Colors & Palette

My brand is built on a foundation of bold reds, clean neutrals, and accent oranges that evoke innovation and energy.

### Primary Colors
- **Ryeo Red**: #C20005 - Bold, energetic, commanding
- **Ryeo Light**: #FFFDF3 - Clean, minimal background
- **Ryeo Dark**: #2C2114 - Deep, sophisticated text
- **Ryeo Accent**: #F39E00 - Vibrant, eye-catching accents

## Typography

Alexandria font provides a modern, clean aesthetic that works both for headings and body text.

## Design Principles

1. **Layering** - Create depth with overlapping elements
2. **Transparency** - Use semi-transparent overlays for visual interest
3. **Motion** - Smooth, seamless transitions between sections
4. **Clarity** - Bold typography and clear hierarchy
